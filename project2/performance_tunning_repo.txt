We have SAX parser to do the parsing of these xml files.
Performance Tuning
1. I parsed the xml files into csv files and updated the database using MySQL load data infile to speed up the process of insertion.
2. I have implemented searching using HashMap in the different parser to speed up the look up process while the program is parsing the xml files.

After populated the data given from Prof, it took around 10 seconds for me to do my updates.
